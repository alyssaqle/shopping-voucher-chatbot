1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

_git clone https://github.com/alyssaqle/shopping-voucher-chatbot.git
cd shopping-voucher-chatbot_

2. Create a .env File

You will need to create a _.env_ file in the root directory of the project (the same level as the backend and frontend folders).

Create a new _.env_ file in the root directory of the project and paste the contents from the file you received.

3. Install Dependencies

You need to install the project dependencies for both the backend and frontend. Use the following commands:

For the Backend

_cd backend_
_npm install_

For the Frontend
Navigate back to the project root:

_cd .._

Navigate to the frontend directory:
_cd frontend_
_npm install_

4. Start the Servers
Backend:
_cd backend
npm start_

Frontend:
Open a new terminal window or tab.
_cd shopping-voucher-chatbot/frontend_

Start the frontend application:
_npm start_

5. Access the Application
Open your web browser and go to:
http://localhost:3000


6. Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, please check the following:

Console Errors: Look for errors in the browser's console.
Server Logs: Check the terminal where the backend server is running for any errors.
Environment Variables: Make sure the .env file is set up correctly without syntax errors.

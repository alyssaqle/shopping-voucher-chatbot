Purpose

This document outlines the workflow for using Git and GitHub effectively as a team to ensure smooth collaboration, reduce conflicts, and maintain a stable codebase.

Branching Strategy

Create a New Branch: Each team member should create a separate branch for each feature or bug fix.
bash
Copy code
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
Make Changes and Commit:
After making changes, stage and commit your changes with a clear message.
bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
Push Your Branch to GitHub:
Push your branch to the remote repository.
bash
Copy code
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
Pull Requests

Create a Pull Request:
After pushing your branch, go to the GitHub repository and create a pull request (PR) from your branch to the main branch.
Code Review:
Team members should review each other's PRs to provide feedback and catch any errors before merging.
Merge Pull Requests:
Once the PR is approved, it can be merged into the main branch. This can be done through the GitHub interface or using the command line.
Avoiding Conflicts

Regularly Pull Changes:
Team members should frequently pull the latest changes from the main branch into their working branch to stay up-to-date.
bash
Copy code
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git merge main
Commit Often:
Make small, frequent commits to help facilitate easier merges.
Clear Communication:
Keep communication open regarding who is working on what features to avoid overlap.
Handling Conflicts

Conflict Resolution:
If a merge conflict occurs, Git will indicate the conflicting files.
Resolve the conflicts manually and then add the resolved files:
bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
Branch Naming Conventions

Use clear naming conventions for branches:
feature/your-feature-name
bugfix/your-bugfix-name
hotfix/urgent-fix
Documentation

Maintain a CONTRIBUTING.md file in the repository that includes this workflow and any additional guidelines for contributing.
Conclusion

By following this workflow, we can enhance our collaboration, minimize conflicts, and ensure a stable codebase. For any questions or clarifications, feel free to reach out!
